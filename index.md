# Supporting the project
More tools and products are being added as I code them and make it public for others. If you like the tools and want to support this, feel free to donate to this BTC address: 1Nu1W9A8VQ9QyYKFWNB9KdtWStDLE84E1j. 

# Status of the project
This is an ongoing project with more tools coming up in future. Pretty soon official site for this project will be made public at bugbounty.site. Some of the projects that are already released can be seen under the *Tools* section above. 

This is an independent project so please do not reach out to my employer with questions. If you have any questions, please email bugbountysite@gmail.com.
