# Updates

*January 5, 2018*

1. More accurate results with subdomain scanner: 

Previously, the output for subdomains contained some down hosts that did not require any checks. With the new update the list of subdomains should be more accurate and upto date. List used for bruteforcing the subdomains is updated every 48 hrs increasing its possibility to find more subdomains.
