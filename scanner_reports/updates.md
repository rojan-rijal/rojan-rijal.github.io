# Updates

*January 5, 2018*

1. **More accurate results with subdomain scanner**: 
Previously, the output for subdomains contained some down hosts that did not require any checks. With the new update the list of subdomains should be more accurate and upto date. List used for bruteforcing the subdomains is updated every 48 hrs increasing its possibility to find more subdomains. 

*January 8, 2018*

1. **Asset Identification**:
Added Censys scanner that generates IPv4 host based on domains that are being searched for. This will include data record of ipv4 address, open protocols and the domains potentially associated with it. 

2. **S3 Bucket**:
S3 bucket listing that lists buckets that are potentially non-readable or readable. Some part of it is linked with S3 Bucket search at tools.bugbounty.site/s3_search
