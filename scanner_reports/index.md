# Scanner-Reports
Public scanner .pdf reports for companies. - Updated every 24 hrs 


# Information
This is a repository with .pdf reports for companies that I am hunting on. All of the companies that will have their record published are public programs. All of these informations are already public so this just makes it easier to search and find informations on the targets. 

**Features**

Following are the features that the reports currently contain: 

1. Subdomains: nmap scans for each subdomains 
2. Safe or not emails: This helps to see if certain company emails were previously found in breaches. This is done so that users can test for password reuse attacks. 

*Future features:*

In future, following details will be added: 

1. s3 Bucket - ACL Policies and s3 buckets listing
2. Company Assets - Data from censys.io and shodan.io 
3. Mobile apps created by company
4. Keywords that can be used to search company in GitHub for potential leakages. 
5. Field that shows new domains (compared with the pdf result from 24 hr before)

# Updating the list
If you notice any wrong information, feel free to open an issue and I will be more than happy to take a look into it. If you want to provide potential domains that can be scanned (must be running a public bug bounty), please email `bugbountysite@gmail.com` and I will respond as soon as possible.
